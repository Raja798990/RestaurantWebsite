# 🍽 Restaurant Platform

## Overview
The **Restaurant Platform** is a smart web application designed to help restaurant owners manage table reservations, display menus, and automate customer communication.  
Built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, it provides both a **customer-friendly booking interface** and a **business management dashboard**.

## 🎯 Objective
Many small and medium-sized restaurants still rely on phone-based or manual bookings, often leading to confusion, double reservations, and missed opportunities.  
This platform modernizes the process by introducing **online reservations**, **menu uploads**, and **automated email or WhatsApp confirmations** through **n8n automation**.
